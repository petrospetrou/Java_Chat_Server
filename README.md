## Overview

This project implements a lightweight backend for a messaging system using the Spring Boot framework. The system allows messages to be stored, accessed, and potentially extended into a real-time chat service.

The application was developed for Assignment 3 of the course and demonstrates backend design using RESTful APIs, object-oriented design principles, and Maven for dependency management.

---

## Features

- Java Spring Boot backend with REST API support
- Message creation and storage
- Message retrieval via REST endpoints
- Modular architecture using MVC design pattern
- Easily extensible to include real-time communication with WebSockets
- Build and run using Maven

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/assignment-3-chat.git
cd assignment-3-chat
```

2. **Build the Application**
```bash
mvn clean install
```

3. **Run the Application**
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. **Access the API**
Once running, the API will be accessible at:  
`http://localhost:8080/api/messages` (or similar endpoint defined in `MessageController`)

---

## Usage

You can interact with the backend using tools like Postman or curl.

- **Get all messages**
  - `GET /api/messages`
- **Post a new message**
  - `POST /api/messages`
  - JSON body: `{ "sender": "John", "content": "Hello, world!" }`

> Note: Actual endpoints and parameters depend on how they're defined in `MessageController.java`.

---

## Known Limitations

- In-memory storage: Messages are not persisted between server restarts
- No frontend implementation: Backend only
- Real-time features (e.g., WebSockets) are not yet implemented

---

## Possible Enhancements

- Add database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
- Implement frontend using React or Vue
- Real-time communication using WebSockets
- User authentication and chatroom support
